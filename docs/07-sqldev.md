# Connect to the schema with Oracle SQL Developer

Open Oracle SQl Developer last version 18+

Create a connection to the schema QUIZFLYWAY (password = AlphA_2014_)

Look at the job build Log "Db_Instance_Creation" and copy the Ip Address of the database

Look at the job build Log of "Db_Instance_Patch" and copy the url connection to the database (ex : "MYPDB.dbsubad2.completevcn.oraclevcn.com")

![Create Empty Project](images/SqlDev.png)

Connect to the database.

Now you can create all objects of the Schema QUIZFLYWAY with a Flyway project...so let's go to another github project (UNDER CONSTRUCTION).
